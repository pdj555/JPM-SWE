# High-Performance Transaction Processing Platform - Architecture

## Overview

The **High-Performance Transaction Processing Platform** is an enterprise-grade system designed to handle high-volume financial transaction processing with strict requirements for consistency, durability, and performance.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Zero-Compromise Performance**

- **Target**: 25,000+ transactions per second sustained throughput
- **Latency**: Sub-100ms p99 end-to-end processing
- **Scalability**: Linear horizontal scaling to handle 20+ billion records per day

### 2. **Enterprise Reliability**

- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime SLA with sub-second failover
- **Consistency**: ACID guarantees with exactly-once processing semantics
- **Durability**: Multi-region data replication with point-in-time recovery

### 3. **Security & Compliance**

- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Audit**: Complete transaction lineage with tamper-proof logging
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with MFA requirements

- Comprehensive metrics and health checks

**Performance Characteristics**:

- **Throughput**: 25,000+ TPS per instance
- **Latency**: <50ms p95 processing time
- **Memory**: <2GB heap with G1GC tuning
- **CPU**: Optimized for modern multi-core processors

### Analytics Engine (Spark Streaming)

**Purpose**: Real-time transaction analytics and aggregation pipeline

**Key Features**:

- Structured streaming with exactly-once processing guarantees
- Multiple aggregation windows (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d)
- Anomaly detection using machine learning models
- Integration with enterprise data warehouse

**Data Flows**:

- **Real-time Aggregations**: Transaction volumes, amounts, patterns
- **Risk Analytics**: Fraud detection, compliance monitoring
